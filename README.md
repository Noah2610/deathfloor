__Work in progress...__  
__Working title...__

## Description
A little platformer game, in which the player must  
jump their way upwards to escape the _deathfloor_.

## Running
Binaries are not yet available.

To compile and run from source, first `clone` the repo,  
then compile and run the project with `cargo` ...
```
cargo run --release
```
Or you can use the development script `bin/run`.  
Note that certain dependencies are required for this script,  
such as `rustup` and a specific `nightly` rust toolchain;  
run the script to see what's missing.  
Any arguments are passed to the underlying `cargo run` command.
