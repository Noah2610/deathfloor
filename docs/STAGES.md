## Abstract:
This document is intended as a plaform for collecting stage / level concepts  
and ideas in a proper structure and to enable a coherent stage by stage vision  
in regards to visual design, gameplay design and music.

## Format:
A rough mockup of a simple and clear format i imagine would work well:

- Stage Theme:  
  Theme the stage revolves around and builds upon
- Tileset:  
  Possible tileset (of the already existing ones) / tileset that somewhat  
  reflects the theme or color scheme and thus can be used as orientation.
- Environmental mechanics:  
  Possible key environmental mechanics the stage could utilize  
  which tie into the theme (both visually and on a gameplay level).
- Enemies:  
  Possible enemy designs that suit the theme visually and mechanically. 
- Movement mechanics:  
  Possible movement mechanics the player could be equipped  
  with for the stage to suit its theme and level design.
- Weapons:  
  Possible weapons the player could be equipped  
  with for the stage to suit its theme and level design.
- Additional information / Details:  
  This category is for information that either doesn't fit into  
  one of the categories listed above, or expands upon them in more detail. 

## Stages:

### Interplanetary Hangar

- Stage themes:
  Gravity, Space, Black / Grey / Red? color scheme
- Possible tileset:
- Environmental mechanics:
  Low gravity + normal friction, maybe other gravity related mechanics, falling asteroids (simple projectiles moving in fixed arc at fixed speed), ...
- Enemies:
- Movement mechanics:
- Weapons:
- Additional information / Details:
  The facilitys spaceship hangar. Parts of the level take place inside (normal grav), parts outside on the hangar platforms (low grav)

### Generator Room 

- Stage themes:
  Electricity, energy, electricity powered installations and machinery. Yellowish color scheme.
- Possible tileset: 
- Environmental mechanics: 
  Electricity barriers, lasers, cycled mechanics (e.g differently colored lasers that switch between active and inactive), "mechanics that are only active under certain conditions" e.g platforms that only move when the player is standing on them (mechanics that allude to an electrical current), light (in terms of visibility -> shaders?)
- Enemies: 
  Enemies that fire projectiles in the form of electric "static" that travel along the floor and walls, enemies that can "shock" (-> briefly stun) the player
- Movement mechanics:
- Weapons:
  Chargable single shot weapon
- Additional information / Details:
  The part of the facility that generates, stores, distributes and manages the power. 

### Waterpark

- Stage themes:
  Water, Coast, White / Orange / Blue color scheme?
- Possible tileset:
  /
- Environmental mechanics:
  Water (Lower gravity + higher friction +), underwater streams (apply constant velocity within "stream field"), Mines (variations -> normal (explode on touch), proximity, proximity timed), exploding barrels, explosions: apply heavy knockback that's specifically tweaked to compliment gravity and friction values
- Enemies:
  Mines, Enemies that drop mines, Enemies that throw "harpoons" that "pin" player / apply constant velocity until player hits solid, 
- Movement mechanics:
- Weapons:
  Harpoon((?) either player weapon or enemy weapon, but it's a cool mechanic so if we make it work it should definitely be introduced in this level)
- Additional Information / Details:
  The facilitys recreational waterpark, located at a seaside coast. The first half of the level you traverse the waterpark itself, the 2nd half takes place in the waterpark's technical rooms.

### Reefer Room 

- Stage themes:
  Frost, Ice, Black- and Blueish color scheme.
- Possible tileset:
- Environmental mechanics:
  Ice, Dropping icicles 
- Enemies:
- Movement mechanics:
- Weapons:
  Freeze gun, single shot. Freezes enemy to a solid icecube that slides on the floor, can be pushed (?) and used as a platform. Chargable? -> impacting things like projectile travel speed, freeze duration, etc...
- Additional Information / Details:
  The part of the facility that functions as storing area for expirables.

### Ancient Ruins

- Stage themes:
  Temple, ruins, ancient tech, traps, brown + one strong primary color
- Environmental mechanics:
  Various kinds of traps and other hazardous contraptions.
- Additional information / Details:
  Ruins of a temple left behind by an ancient alien civilisation millions of years ago. Before the AI took over, the facility offered guided tours to tourists.

### Greenhouse 

- Stage themes:
  Plants, air, organics, green white and "transparent" / glass color scheme
- Area that produces and supplies the facility with breathable air. Different kinds of vegetation in various types of glass containers. Some plants have broken out of their containers and started to grow wildly because the AI has neglected the area since she's taken over (for obvious reasons).


### Factory

- Stage themes: 
  Construction, Metal
- Environmental mechanics: Conveyer belts, lots of moving "parts" (platforms, horizontal and vertical), a lot of the mechanics being cycle based
