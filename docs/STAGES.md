## Abstract:
This document is intended as a plaform for collecting stage / level concepts  
and ideas in a proper structure and to enable a coherent stage by stage vision  
in regards to visual design, gameplay design and music.

## Format:
A rough mockup of a simple and clear format i imagine would work well:

- Stage Theme:  
  Theme the stage revolves around and builds upon
- Tileset:  
  Possible tileset (of the already existing ones) / tileset that somewhat  
  reflects the theme or color scheme and thus can be used as orientation.
- Environmental mechanics:  
  Possible key environmental mechanics the stage could utilize  
  which tie into the theme (both visually and on a gameplay level).
- Enemies:  
  Possible enemy designs that suit the theme visually and mechanically. 
- Movement mechanics:  
  Possible movement mechanics the player could be equipped  
  with for the stage to suit its theme and level design.
- Weapons:  
  Possible weapons the player could be equipped  
  with for the stage to suit its theme and level design.
- Additional information / Details:  
  This category is for information that either doesn't fit into  
  one of the categories listed above, or expands upon them in more detail.
