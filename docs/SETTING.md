# Setting and Story

## Setting Idea 1

- Rough setting:
Game takes place in the somewhat distant future on a foreign planet or moon. The planet has been terraformed to accomodate human life as part of
the construction process of a recreational facility. Shortly before completion, with only a few actual humans being stationed on the planet to oversee the final steps of (automated) construction, 
the AI that's in place to manage the facility gains sentience and turns against its creators, seizing power over the planet in the process. Threatened by the now hostile environment, the humans are forced to withdraw into the safety of a small, isolated control center (which will function as hub area for the game).
As the slowly run out of food, their desperation leads them to assemble a robot out of scraps they find laying around, their last hope of regaining control over the planet. Operating the robot, the player must little by little "liberate" parts of the planet / the facility. 

- Opening:
The game opens with a simple "cutscene", presented as an infomercial for the planet, highlighting its flora and fauna as well as various parts of the recreational facility. (A few simple, maybe slightly animated images accompanied by text)
Suddenly the cutscene "glitches out" (animation), and a 2nd cutscene plays that shows / vaguely implies the AI taking over. (maybe through some sort of some cheesy abstraction)
Fade to black, text starts scrolling -> journal entry from one of the humans, giving the player a quick rundown of what happened (having it be a journal entry is an elegant way of framing an exposition dump)

- Story structure:
I would tell most of the story (apart from opening and finale) through the hub area, thus keeping it mostly optional. Everytime the player beats a level and returns to the hub area, the humans there have new dialogue, there's a new journal entry and an evergrowing compendium of encountered enemy types to check, etc... -> optional interactions with various aspects of the hub area. 
When the player starts a new level, he is prompted with a short and simple cutscene, similar to the opening - kept in the style of an infomercial but focusing on the specific stage. At some point the cutscene glitches out and shows a partly obscured (maybe dimly lit) image of the stage's boss.
